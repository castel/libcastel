# Castel libraries

Please see the [official homepage](http://castel.github.com) for more informations.

Bug reports should be reported on the bug tracker of the [castel compiler](https://github.com/castel/castel) repository.

## Compilation

You will need LLVM 3.2, Ragel, Lemon, Clang and CMake.

*Note: When compiling with Clang, you will probably need the `libunwind` package if you get errors about an `_Unwind_Exception` structure*

    $> git clone git@github.com:castel/libcastel
    $> mkdir libcastel/build
    $> cd libcastel/build
    $> cmake ..
    $> make

The libraries will be generated in the `lib/` directory, and their headers will be in the `includes` directory.
